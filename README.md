> plain text configuration files for my linux systems

Dotfiles are plain text configuration files on Unix-y systems for things like our shell, ~/.zshrc, our editor in ~/.vimrc, and many others. They are called "dotfiles" as they typically are named with a leading . making them hidden files on your system, although this is not a strict requirement.

Since these files are all plain text, we can gather them together in a git repository and use that to track the changes you make over time.

# pavan's dotfiles

Uses Git [subtree][] and submodules to keep my dotfiles in one place
in an elegant manner. With inspiration from [xero][], uses [GNU Stow][]
to symlink files one folder deep to the folder above.
